AT1G01550	bps1-2	Growth of bps1-2 mutants on CPTA-supplemented medium resulted in partial rescue of both leaf and root defects. bps1-2 mutants grown on control growth medium have small radialized leaves with very little vascular tissue, and very short misshapen knotted-looking roots. By contrast, bps1-2 mutants grown on CPTA-supplemented medium produced larger flattened leaves that contained primary and secondary veins, and smooth elongated roots.	17217459
AT1G01550	bps1-2	Mutant roots were abnormal; primary and lateral roots were short, root hairs formed close to the root apex, and root defects were most severe when plants were grown at low temperature.	15458645
AT1G01550	bps1-2	Under high light conditions (approximately 200 &mu;E.m-2.sec-1), CPTA-treated seedlings were completely photobleached and mutants showed rescue of both leaf and root development. Under moderate (approximately 100 &mu;E.m-2.sec-1) and low (30 &mu;E.m-2.sec-1) light intensities, seedlings are incompletely photobleached, but leaf and root development continue to show partial rescue.	17217459

Shorter root and hypocotyl than WT.  Plants grown in soil have smaller rosettes, fewer rosette leaves, and shorter primary inflorescence stems than WT.  Also has shorter siliques containing fewer seeds than WT.  Pale green in color.	14745029

AT1G04160	xi-2 / xi-b	The overall growth of the xi-2 / xi-b double mutant is normal. In the leaf epidermis, Golgi stacks and peroxisomes move more slowly in these mutant cells than in wild-type cells. The rate of mitochondrial movement is also slightly reduced. Root hair length is reduced to ~15% of the wild type root hair length in these double mutants, but their root hair density is very similar to the wild type density.	19060218

AT1G05180	AXL/axl-1 axr1-12	Homozygous axr1-12 plants that are heterozygous for axl-1 display severe growth defects. These seedlings developed short, slow growing roots compared with wild-type roots, and were arrested at the late seedling stage.	17655650
AT1G05180	AXL/axl-1 axr1-12	The columella of AXL/axl-1 axr1-12/axr1-12 root tips is highly disorganized during early seedling root growth, and is completely disrupted at the time when root growth ceases.	17655650

AT1G06290	acx3-4	Plants display decreased sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) on root elongation, while remaining sensitive to inhibitory concentrations of indole-3-acetic acid.  They maintain their ability to initiate lateral roots in response to IBA.	15743450
AT1G08030	SALK_009847	Seedlings of tpst-1 had stunted roots and smaller cotyledons compared with the WT.  tpst-1 has an abnormally shaped root apical meristem due to disorganized cell division and expansion. At 15 days after germination, the leaves of the tpst-1 plants are small and pale green, the number of higher order veins is reduced, and the secondary veins often do not close.  At the flowering stage, tpst-1 has smaller rosettes, tiny leaves showing early senescence, shorter inflorescence, and a reduced number of flowers and siliques. The fertility and seed set of tpst-1 are normal.	19666544
AT1G08260	tilted1-4	Twenty-five percent of embryos show abnormal cell divisions during embryogenesis-large cells- decreased rate of cell division. Division of the hypohyseal cell abnormal leading to abnormal placement of the root pole. Homozygotes show delayed flowering, abnormal floraly phyllotaxy and abnormal ovules.	16278345

AT1G10570	ots1-1 ots2-1	The ots1-1 ots2-1 double mutant plants flower earlier than wild type plants under long days and short days. They do not differ notably from wild type plants with respect to their overall growth rate, inflorescence structure, or seedling primary root elongation rate. But, they are hypersensitive to salt based on root elongation assays. They also have a higher level of SUMOylated proteins than wild type seedlings exposed to salt stress.	18849491
AT1G11130	scm-1	Position of root-hair cells is scrambled.  Only 66% of epidermal cells (compared with 92% in wild type) overlying two cortical cells develop as root hairs, and 21% of epidermal cells overlying one cortical cell (compared with 1% in wild type) develop as root hairs.	15618487

AT1G13290	dot5-1	dot5-1 mutants have a misaligned venation defect in their leaves and cotyledons. Their phenotypes may vary somewhat, but dot5-1 mutants often have shorter roots and delayed leaf initiation compared to wild-type seedlings. They also have an abnormal petiole length and phyllotaxy. Apical dominance is reduced in dot5-1 mutants, and they appear to be hypersensitive to an application of the polar auxin transport inhibitor NPA.	18643975
AT1G14290	sbh1-1 sbh2-1	Dwarf plants with reduced vigor, dies before expansion of the true leaves, necrotic lesions on cotyledons.

AT1G16150	wakl4-1	Seedlings consistently show retarded root growth when grown in full- or one-half-strength MS nutrients and are hypersensitive, as assayed by a root elongation assay, to Na+, K+, Zn2+ and Cu2+.	16286448
AT1G17110	ubp15-1	ubp15-1 mutants exhibit several anatomical defects related to leaf, root, flower, stem, and silique development. Notably, rosette leaves are narrow and serrated. An examination of ubp15-1 leaf cross-sections reveals a reduction in the number of adaxial epidermal and palisade cells spanning the width of the leaf. ubp15-1 mutant leaves also have fewer spongy cell layers than wild type leaves. The aberrant phenotype of this mutant is exacerbated when it is crossed with ubp16-1.	18485060
AT1G17170	gst	As for the root growth assay, the root elongation of both the mutant and the wild-type was inhibited at lower concentrations of TNT than 2,6-DNT. In addition, there was no statistically significant difference of the root elongation between the gst mutant and the wild-type exposed to different concentrations of 2,6-DNT and TNT from t-test.
AT1G17440	eer4	Roots are extremely curled.   Dark-grown seedlings are hypersensitive to ethylene. Extreme hypocotyl shortening is observed when grown on 100ul /L ethylene.
AT1G17580	SALK_019031C	There are no obvious defects in the aerial tissues, roots, or root hairs of xi-1 mutant plants grown under normal conditions. There are also no obvious defects in organelle trafficking, except for a slight effect on peroxisome movement. Double mutant analysis reveals a greater role for XI-1 in organelle movement and plant development (see xik-2/xi-1).	18178669
AT1G17580	xi-k / xi-1	The xi-k / xi-1 double mutant plants are shorter and have smaller rosettes than wild type plants. Their reduced leaf size results from decreased cell size and decreased cell number. These double mutants produce fewer seeds per silique than wild type plants. In the leaf epidermis, Golgi stacks, peroxisomes, and mitochondria move more slowly in these mutant cells than in wild-type cells. Root hair length is reduced to ~35% of the wild type root hair length in these double mutants, but their root hair density is very similar to the wild type density.	19060218
AT1G18350	bud1	bud1 plants develop significantly fewer  lateral roots, simpler venation patterns, and a quicker and greater curvature in the gravitropism assay. In addition, the bud1  plants have shorter hypocotyls at high temperature (29C) under light, which is a characteristic feature of defective auxin  action. Determination of tritium-labeled indole-3-acetic acid transport showed that the increased expression of MKK7 in bud1  or the repressed expression in MKK7 antisense transgenic plants causes deficiency or enhancement in auxin transport,  indicating that MKK7 negatively regulates polar auxin transport.	16377756
AT1G18800	nrp1-1 nrp2-1	Double mutant plants showed a short-root phenotype: roots grew like the wild-type roots until 6 d after germination (DAG). However, after 7 DAG, the elongation of the double mutant roots was dramatically reduced compared with the wild-type roots. The aerial organs (leaves, rosettes, inflorescences, flowers, fruits, and embryos) developed normally in the double mutant plants.
AT1G19220	CS24617	The primary roots of the mutant produce as many lateral roots as the wild type.	15659631
